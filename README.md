# HisApp

Version: 0.04

+==========+

A Express+node application written in Javascript and EJS that presents the user with a 5 question quiz.

To launch the application simply arrive at the package directory and call 'app.js' using node in your terminal. The default port is 9999, though feel free to change this in the settings provided by me in app.js (Line 14).
